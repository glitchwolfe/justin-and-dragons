# To Do

* UX Improvements:
- Translate vertical scroll wheel activity into horizontal scroll

* Presentation/Extra Polish:
- Figure out a place to use the DnD poster
- Create an intro slide/screen

* Party Members:
- Improve the logic behind comparing party members on event changes
- Fix animations for members joining/leaving
- Adjust positioning of party members
- Choose new sprites for all party members

* Backgrounds:
- Fix width calculation for parallax layers (in firefox)
- Find a solution for crossfading from scene to scene, CSS transition is very resource intensive

# Long-Term To Do's

- Add Page: Player
  - Show a list of characters that player has used
  - Show player/character statistics
  - Hotlink mentions of this player to this page
- Add Page: Location
  - Hotlink mentions of this location to this page
